My Dear Boy,<!--more-->

[I now take my MacBook in lap][intmp] to let you know that at present I am well. In a few weeks you’ll be born, but at the present you’re kicking and punching your mother’s insides like a champion MMA fighter on fight night in Vegas.

One day you’ll grow to be a man and hopefully I’ll be there to help you through the hard times, but if for some reason I’m not I hope these letters can guide you.

Everything's ready for you now. We have your room all set up and a car seat and warm clothes to keep you comfortable. 

Your Mother and I are having nightly dreams of how you'll be born and when you'll decide it's time. My bag is packed, so is your Mothers, and yours sits beside them both. Waiting for your arrival.

Right now our hearts are already yours. We think about you more than we even know. You're already influencing our lives and every decision we make and we're over the moon thinking about the things we'll get to show you and teach you.

Mommies belly is big and round. You’ve pushed her belly out to sizes we never thought it would reach. We can see you moving in there as you get too big for your living quarters. Punching and kicking and pushing around. You’ve even punched and kicked me in the face a few times as I’ve pressed my face to her belly to have a chat with you. Hopefully you know it’s me in there! I’d like you to know who I am before you get here. Just a hint, I’m the big hairy guy whose boobs don’t feed you.

Soon I’ll meet you and you’ll change my world forever. For the better.

I love you already, and I’ll love you to the end of my days.

Love,<br>
Daddy
