What the heck is co-sleeping?<!--more-->

<img src="/assets/images/birth-of-jesus-1150128_640.jpg" class="float-right" style="width:24rem; padding-left:2rem;" alt="">We have so far decided to try our little one sleeping in a bassinet beside our bed for the first little while. To help with feedings and for our own mental well-being. Sometimes you just have to check to make sure baby's still breathing. Co-sleeping doesn't sound like the right choice for us and frankly we're not thrilled about the horror stories we've heard about 5 year-olds that won't sleep if they're not with Mom and Dad. We also have a horror story of our own in the form of a 60lb Viszla who co-sleeps and can out cry any baby I've ever met. We've tried numerous times (sometimes for months) to get him off the bed to no avail. 

Sorry kid Odin was here first and the bed is one place I don't see him surrendering easily. For you or me. 

We do however have the advantage of being a flexible pair when it comes to changing situations. We're good at rolling with the punches. 

Time for a move:

We’re a handy couple, like really handy. We have another blog all about how handy we are. When we came out as parents to be, quite a few people’s first reaction was “I can’t wait to see the crib you build!” and “Are you going to build your own crib?”. After a little thought and pricing we decided that the time, effort, and money was too much of a commitment for our busy professional and social calendars. So we went crib shopping.

Where’d we net out? Ikea.

It might sound crazy to some but we didn’t see any reason to be spending a thousand dollars on a crib. We didn’t see reason to spend five-hundred on a crib. It’s a place for baby to sleep and something for him to chew on and cry and poop in. He’ll never care what it looks like, and for us as long as it fits the room we’re great with something cheaper. Seeing as how the room already has Ikea furniture in it (see our Billy Bookshelf build) it fit perfectly.

$249.99 later we had a crib for our baby.

But your decision might not be so easy. So here are a few rules for choosing a crib to help you out.

1. Ensure the crib has passed any necessary safety precautions for your area.
2. Firm mattress is better. It’s been recommended by many professional institutions that a firm mattress is better for baby. More comfortable and safer.
3. Convertible? Lots of cribs can lower to toddler height and even have a side removed to convert to your little one’s “big-kid bed”. The crib we went with has both of these features and gives us piece of mind that we won't be bed shopping for at least a few years. 
4. Second hand cribs. Make sure you check your second hand crib over and over and over for any peeling paint, splinters, or loose parts. If it’s REALLY old check for lead paint or just sand all the paint off and start fresh. Honestly, it will take a long time but it will be very worth it. I find drinking while sanding large pieces to be very therapeutic. 

Whatever method or theory you go with let what you do be what you do. Don't listen to the naysayers. The back seat parenters. If you're happy and baby is healthy that's all you need right?
