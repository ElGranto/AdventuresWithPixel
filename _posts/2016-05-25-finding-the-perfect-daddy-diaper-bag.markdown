Being involved with Pixel is of the upmost importance to me.<!--more--> So much so that I'm taking the parental leave while Kristen goes back to work.

This leaves me in a little bit of a predicament. I'm not fond of the idea of carrying around Kristen's Coach diaper bag. No matter how fancy it is it still looks like a purse and she strictly forbid me from sewing any motorcycle patches on it. 

Okay I need a Daddy diaper bag.

First thing's first. Messenger? Or Backpack?

After a bunch of reading I decided on a backpack as they're easier to wear if you're strollerless and wearing baby in a carrier. 

Searching the web for Daddy friendly diaper bags resulted in two names coming up over and over. [Diaper Dude][dd] and [Dadgear][dadgear]. Diaper Dude has some pretty nice bags. But Dadgear is much more feature heavy and they've got even nicer designs. I also managed to sniff out a really nice bag by [Sons of Trade][sot] sold by [Petunia Pickle Bottom][ppb] (isn't that name awesome) and one on [Etsy][etsy]. 

The problem here is they're all from America and shipping to Canada is more than a bitch when it comes to duty and all-that. With all ending up well over my desired budget. 

[Fisher-Price][fp] has a few black, less purse shaped bags available in Canada. But online reviews were pretty dismal. 

[Skip Hop][sh] also has some more masculine patterns but they still maintain a more purse like shape. 

So what now?

I started looking at non-diaper specific backpacks and found many were lacking in pocket space and one thing I read over and over is that a diaper bag is most efficient when it's organized. 

This is where [Timbuk2][t2] came in. Being hardcore messenger bags they tend to have decent pocket layouts. They're a little pricey but with a store conveniently on Queen street in downtown Toronto I could check out their whole lineup in person. They even have a messenger style diaper bag!

Arriving at the store a half hour before they were open was a problem though. Kristen saw a [Hershel][her] bag in the window of the Little Burgundy store next door so not wanting to leave without doing any looking we went in. They had bags from Hershel and [Fjällräven][fr]. None with many pockets though.

Then I saw it... 

The PERFECT Daddy diaper bag!

The [Burton Back Hill Duffle XS][burton].

This bag is made of incredibly durable Cordura fabric. It holds 25L so it will never get too heavy. It has six pockets, one of which is a waterproof shoe pocket perfect for dirty clothes or blankets. It has a shoulder strap AND built in backpack straps so it can be carried either way! The shoulder strap mounts also work great for attaching the bag to the stroller with the addition on an extra $9 Mommy Hook (see my thoughts on that name in my [previous post][mommy-hook]).

With the addition of a Skip Hop [Grab and Go][gng] bottle cooler with a built in ice pack, and a [Pronto Changing Station][pcs], some diapers, cream, a blanket, and a change of clothes and you're ready for a day out!

All in all this bag is absolutely amazing and perfect for me. Being an ex professional snowboarding instructor and still avid snowboarder it shows off that I'm not just another Dad carrying around some premade diaper bag that is just a different color of what's available in a more woman centric diaper bag industry.
