A rose by any other name,

What do you call your dick? What did you call it when you were a kid?

Wee-wee, wiener, pee pee, winkie, ding-dong?

My brother and I each had a widger. Hilarious I know. My father in law refers to them as duo-ding-dang. I'm not sure if this is a name his kids used or if it's a more recent vernacular just to be funny (he is hilarious by the way).

Ultimately when you have offspring you'll eventually have to think about what your kids will call their own junk.

Our thought on the matter is that it’s important for our child to understand that his “bathing suit area” is no different from any other part of his body and doesn’t deserve special naming conventions.

Penis will do for our little guy.

As for the entire area we’ll be sticking with “genitals”. I feel that “Private parts” imparts an idea of secret that we’d rather not apply while our child is young, hopefully this will cultivate a healthy respect and opens for his sexual organs. Using the correct terminology for sexual organs will also allow for easier communication with authority figures that he may need to interact with in the future (doctors etc.).

Using the proper name also doesn’t imply that there’s something wrong with the word. Some kids think “Penis” is a bad word. Why? Penis isn’t a bad word. It’s just a part of every man’s body. Some people see a taboo behind using the words penis and vagina in public but we don’t. I see no place in this world for prudishness.

Whatever you decide it’s something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Something that will effect your conversations with your child and the conversations your child will have with others for quite a long time.
