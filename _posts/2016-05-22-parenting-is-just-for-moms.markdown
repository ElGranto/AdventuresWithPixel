Everything's for Moms. What about me?<!--more-->

<img src="/assets/images/MommyHook.JPG" class="float-right" style="width:23rem; padding:0 0 2rem 2rem;" alt="">Something K really wanted as an attachment for the stroller is "The Mommy Hook". Essentially a giant carabiner for hanging shopping bags or a purse or what-have-you on the stroller. 

My first reaction was "What about me?! Why don't I get a hook?".

This isn't the first time this has happened either. The swimming class that I will be attending with my son is called "From Tummies to Mummies" (we checked, men are welcome). 

This stuff really irks me. With more and more men taking on more family duties than ever before it's time for us to drop the thought that Mom is the only one taking care of baby. Frankly it's insulting. I can do everything she can do with the exception of making the milk. 

Using the word "Mom" or "Mommy" when any parent could be involved is divisive in nature. It silently implies (surely not on purpose in most cases) that Dad is not wanted or included. What about children without a Mommy? Two Daddies are just as good as a Mommy and a Daddy!

What can we do as men and women who see this as a personal issue? I'll be writing an email to the makers of "The Mommy Hook" for starters. I'll also be talking to the people in charge at the community centre we'll be attending to bring up the idea of changing the name of the class to one that's more inclusive.
