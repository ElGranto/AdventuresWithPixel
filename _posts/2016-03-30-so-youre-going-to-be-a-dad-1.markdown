You're gonna be a Dad! - Survival preparedness for new dads: Part 1

<img src="/assets/images/costumes-625440_640.jpg" class="float-left" style="width:18rem; padding-right:2rem;" alt="">So you're going to be a new dad hey? Once you're done freaking out there's a few thing you need to consider, buy, and prepare. Ok let's not sugar coat it. There's a lot you need to consider, a lot you need to prepare, and even more that you need to buy. 

Let's start from the second you find out. 

Firstly talk with your partner. Will you tell people right away? Some people do but especially if it's your first a visit to the doctor will be a good idea. Get to an OB and have an appointment. They'll take both of your family histories and look at your partner's medical past. Don't be offended if the conversation is more about her. You've got nine months ahead of her getting all the attention so get used to it now. If your doctor feels that your partner is a high risk pregnancy (like ours did) it's probably a good idea to keep your newly forming poop machine under wraps for the first few months. The chance of loss within the first three months is high even when there's no medical complications with Mom. 

If you simply can't hold it in, do what I did. Have a good think about your friends and who you can really trust to keep the news to themselves. I'm talking no girlfriends, other buddies, postmen, or bartenders can know about this kid. Ok got that guy? Take him out for a beer. Buy the first round  and during that first pint stress that you have something important to tell him that he can't breathe a word of to anyone but you in a private setting for at least three months. Then let him have it. Hopefully you have the day off tomorrow cause congrats you're about to get wasted. Hopefully on his dime too!

Now, how will you tell your loved ones?

We lucked out and our three month mark was right around Christmas. So it was a no brainer for us. Framed ultrasounds for all the parents went over like a freight train right to the feelings zone.

Do you have a car? Being urbanites we didn't. If you can swing it now's the time to look in to getting one. Even in the city of Toronto getting around to all the baby stores and doctors appointments is tough on transit or uber. A car helps immensely with day to day baby shopping and getting stuff home. Cribs come in big boxes. 

After you've considered all this do something fun. Go for a shopping day with the Momma to be and each of you in secret buy a little gift for the baby. It's a fun little thing to do to start the bonding between you and your son or daughter to be. Don't forget your partner either. Might as well pick her up something too. She's got a rough time ahead of her, much rougher than you do.
