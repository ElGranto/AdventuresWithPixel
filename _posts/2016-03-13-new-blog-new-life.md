The first post on a blog is sometimes the hardest. Do we introduce ourselves? I don't know. So I'll put a list of questions and answers and you can read the ones you want.

<ul class="accordion" data-accordion data-allow-all-closed="true" data-multi-expand="true">
  <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Q: "What's up with your name man?"</h3></a>
    <div class="accordion-content clearfix" data-tab-content>
    	A: Long ago in a life that seems more dream and less reality now I was given a tshirt from a good friend for my birthday that said "El Granto" on it. The rest was history. If you want to learn more you can check out this post on our sister site <a href="http://www.storefrontlife.com/el-granto/" target="_blank">Storefront Life</a>.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Q: "What's up with "Pixel"?"</h3></a>
    <div class="accordion-content clearfix" data-tab-content>
    	A: During her first trimester Kristen was in and out of the doctors office a lot. She was concidered a high risk pregnancy as she has a very extreme case of celiac desease. During our fist ultrasoud we were able to see the faintest of heart beats. Just a little flashing pixel on the screen. From that moment on what most people call their "Peanut" we called ours "Pixel".
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h3>Q: "What kind of dog is Odin?"</h3></a>
    <div class="accordion-content clearfix" data-tab-content>
    	<img src="/assets/images/odinSweater.jpg" class="float-right" style="width:26rem;" alt="">
    	A: Odin is a Hungarian Vizsla, also known as a velcro dog. As a breed they are well known for never wanting to leave your side and always needing a cuddle. Odin can usually be found in whatever room El Granto is in either curled up under a blanket or looking for some way to cause trouble.
