I'm not sure how to star this blog. So I'll put a list of questions and answers and you can read the ones you want.

<ul class="accordion" data-accordion data-allow-all-closed="true" data-multi-expand="true">
  <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Q: "What's up wih your name man?"</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      A: Long ago in a life that seems more dream and less reality now I was given a tshirt from a good friend for my birthday that said "El Granto" on it. The rest was history. If you want to learn more you can check out this post on our sister site <a href="http://www.storefrontlife.com/el-granto/" target="_balnk">Storefront Life</a>.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Accordion 2</a>
    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
      I would start in the open state, due to using the `is-active` state class.
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
