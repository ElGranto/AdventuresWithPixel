Late one December evening in 2015 my wife sat down beside me and said two words that would forever change my life.

"I'm pregnant."

During the next few sleepless days and nights we came up with a plan on how to move forward with our lives with the upcoming baby to be. Rough seeds of plans for leave, birth, informing parents and friends slowly came together and the idea to start up an offshoot of our other blog <a href="http://www.storefrontlife.com" target="_blank">Storefront Life</a> were planted.

So here you go. Here's my adventures with Pixel.
